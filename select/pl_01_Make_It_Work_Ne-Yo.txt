You understand me
At least you say you do
Mainly that's enough for me
Looking for perfect
Surrounded by artificial
You're the closest
thing to real I see
Sure everyone
had their problem
That's a given
You're the easiest
to tolerate
This wasn't what
we was wanting
How we're living
But let's take this
good enough and
turn it to great
Baby Undertsand
This can only be as good as
we both make it
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
We can be as happy as
we want to be girl
But We gotta make it work
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
Sometimes I love you
more than you'll ever know
other times you
get on my nerves
That's just reality
No it ain't
can't always be
Kisses hugs and
beautiful words
You was looking
for your prince
What you find
what you found
Is a pauper with potential
And no I'm no
where near perfect
But I'm around
but I'm around
Girl time and
patience is essential
Baby realize
This can only be as good as
we both make it
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
We can be as happy as
we want to be girl
But we gotta make it work
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
oh Millions think the bad out
weighs the good sometimes
That doesn't mean
we're supposed to give it up
My problems are yours
and yours are mine
This can only be as good as
we both make it
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
Yes sometimes it's gonna hurt
We can be as happy as
we want to be girl
But we gotta make it work
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah
oh We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
We gotta make it work
ah oh ah oh oh
